SMS-PI
======

We are now a subscription based service due to scammers and spammers.

We can offer free accounts to those who promote the service and provide proof they are.

We have a monthly subscription of Â£5 this gives you:

2000 free sms to send with no sender id and no delivery reports but you can get replys back and have your own incoming keyword and change the keyword.

We have a Paid SMS service.

This gives your 2000 free sms and what ever paid sms you have paid for and will give you a years subscription to the service.

You can then use the paid SMS api which gives you the ability to change the sender id and find out if the sms has been delivered.

we auto update every paid sms if it's been develivered or not.

we will also auto top up any account if you run out of free sms.

again you get your own incoming keyword and have the ability to change it.
